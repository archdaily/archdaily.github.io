Maybe you tried *VIM* in the past and you don't understand how this primitive tool can increase your "code writing" performance.
But maybe you tried with the wrong *VIM* version...

My mission today is change that bad feeling about *VIM*.

###The essentials steps to transform *VIM* into a real cool guy:
1. *VI* != *VIM*, *VIM* is evolution, *VI* is legacy crap.
2. To use *VIM* you must learn how to use it...that sounds really obvious, but believe me you need courage to learn *VIM*
3. *VIM* is like a car, if you improve your car components, your car goes faster and looks better...and you will be proud of it.


###VIM Components
- If you have OSX, I recommend [this MacVim version](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles):
- If you have Linux, I recommend [this VIM/GVIM version](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus)

"So..I already installed my new VIM, but I don't know how to use these vim components"

Those VIM versions(or distributions) have very useful plugins and snippets:

- ***[NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)***: Show your working directory and allows you navigate into the folders and open files into current vim buffer.

- ***[CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)***: The evolution of Command-T plugin, allows you to search a file, word, tag, buffer inside you project directory.
- ***[SnipMate](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate)***: Defines text snippets (a series of characters) that expand to a useful piece of code when tab is pressed.

Also there are a lot of vim tutorials like:

[Vimcasts.org](http://vimcasts.org/)

[Interactive VIM Tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html)

[VIM Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com)

If you're not convinced yet, let me show you a screencast about you can do in VIM

Oh..wait, *VIM* is only a text editor, right?

Nope!

*VIM* also can edit images, here is an example called
***[Afterimage](https://github.com/tpope/vim-afterimage)***

So... *VIM* can be a cool guy if you want :)
