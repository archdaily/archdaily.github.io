The organization and management of a software development team is one of the key factors to create 
quality software, so is crucial for software teams to have clear definitions and apply good practices
to make the management of the team a strength more than a weakness. In this article, We're going to
explain how ArchDaily's Development Team handle its day to day job and why We use the methodology that
We use.

<!-- more -->

Handling and manage a software development team can be a daunting task due to several factors, such as:

* __Team size__: as team grows up the communications between members of the team became more difficult,
making organization harder.
* __Location__: some teams are distributed on different locations around the world. Again, the communication
becomes harder, creating problems on team's organization.
* __Lack of a structured methodology__: sometimes dev teams doesn't follow a defined methodology. This creates
noise in the daily job of members and obviously makes harder to track and review the progress of the team.

Teams not necessarily need to follow one of the standard software methodologies, but it can be a big mistake
to not follow any methodology at all. Just make sure your team is being managed in a clear and structured way
and that every member of the team are committed (and in agreement) with the used methodology.

Here at ArchDaily, We follow an agile approach and our framework of choice is Scrum. This framework gives some
useful guidelines (which can be adapted to every team's needs) and the support of online management tools for
this methodology is huge. Before going into the details of our version of Scrum, let's explain how is the architecture of our team.

## Team Infraestructure

The general picture is:

<img src="/images/team_architecture.png" alt="Team Architecture" class="full-image"/>

In the graph above, it can be seen the general infrastructure of AD's dev team. In general:

* __CTO__: is the main leader of the team. This role is in charge of define the general work guidelines of the entire
team and it's the connection between the company strategic decisions and how the dev team transforms those decisions
into real software requirements.
* __Lead Backend Developers__: these are the leaders of several software projects in the organization. This hierarchical representation
of the team its due the high number of projects to manage and also the high number of developers in the team. This role
allows to simplify the communication between stakeholders in each project and is a sane way for the CTO to have visibility on the entire team.

Next roles are very self-explanatory:

* Frontends
* DevOps
* Backend Developers

The main reason to decouple the standard dev role into more specific roles is to improve communication workflow inside the team.
In general, every Lead Backend Developer form a sub-team with its Backend Developers. The frontend and DevOps are sub-teams by themselves.

With a well defined infrastructure, the next step is to define how the chosen methodology is going to be used.

## Scrum through AD's eyes

Scrum is a well known framework for software management which became highly popular when agile software methodologies made their
appearance. The workflow in Scrum is based on different stages and elements. The next ones are the key elements for our own workflow:

* __Backlog Planning__: In this stage, the CTO has a planning meeting with each sub-team (the second row of the team infrastructure).
For example, the CTO meets a Lead Backend Developer with all the Backend Developers of their team. In this meeting, the CTO communicates
to each team the work that needs to be done during the current iteration. This work is represented as high level user stories and the
main objective of the meeting is to create well defined (in the sense of a developer) stories to accomplish the high level user stories.
__This meeting needs to be done the first day of the iteration__.
* __Iteration Size__: we decided to use __2 week__ for each iteration. This timespan suits our needs the best due to the kind of requirements
that We do (commonly We develop user stories big enough to span more than a week).
* __Daily Meetings (or Standups)__: Every day, the entire team has a general short meeting in which each member of the team gives a brief
overview of their work the past day and the work for today and also shares problems and interesting findings to the rest of the team. 
It must be noted that in this meeting __we do not solve any problem at all__. If one of the members found a blocking problem and other member
has some solution, after the meeting both can have a more personal meeting to discuss in more detail their thoughts. __The meeting must not 
exceed 15-20 minutes__. This meeting allows to every member of the team to have __visibility__ and to improve software reuse by sharing solutions 
to common problems between members.
* __Constant Backlog Revision__: During the iteration is allowed to add more stories to the backlog by any member of the team. This is useful
for example if a dev thinks that one story can be splitted in two more atomic stories. __We favor atomic stories in the backlog__.

## Implementation

The online tool that we use for our software development workflow is [PivotalTracker](http://pivotaltracker.com/). Basically, We've 
one project for every sub-team inside our main team:

* Backend Projects: one project for each backend sub-team
* Frontend Project: a project for the frontend team
* Ops Project: a project for DevOps related tasks

To have entire visibility of team's tasks, PivotalTracker has the concept of [Workspaces](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/blog/wonders-workspaces):

<img alt="PT Workspaces" src="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/marketing_assets/blog/2014/09/MPworkspace-1024x493-a8931f0d384aac220709d75472cd3063741cb87de2a4b88576fbe732b35bc6fb.png" class="full-image" />

which gives the ability to have in one board, access to selected (or all) the boards on different projects.

In PivotalTracker, exist four different types of stories:

* __Features__: These represents the typical concept of an user story. Features deliver verifiable business value to project's stakeholders.
* __Chores__: These kind of stories do not add direct value to stakeholders (for example: "Update SSL Certs") but they are necessary for the
success of the project.
* __Bugs__: They are indeed bugs found in the project.
* __Releases__: These are merely milestones markers. They represent a point in time where a group of stories (or more general, a complete feature) needs to
be done.

### Backlog Planning In Practice

For the backlog planning, developers should use the Icebox board in the current working project. Every new feature should be added to the icebox as
a feature/chore story (or several stories) and it should be as atomic as possible. If in the backlog planning meeting, devs note that is going to take
to much time to split a general feature into atomic stories, then after the meeting (in no more than 2 days) the owner or requester of that feature should do that job.

After adding all the stories for the current iteration into the icebox, the corresponding owner together with the CTO should move every story into the backlog and
__estimate__ the points for that story (__in our case, every point correspond to 1 working hour__). As a general rule, there can be no unestimated stories in
the backlog.

As the final result of this stage, __the icebox should be empty and the backlog should have all estimated features (as atomic as possible) to do in the current iteration__. 

#### Organization of Cards in the Backlog Planning Stage

A general PivotalTracker card looks like:

<img alt="PivotalTracker card" src="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/kb_assets/adding_stories_3@2x-ef01c2c48c8a26b1fd91dc6f628b1b86793d443071b10da6ff388e9a6a08de04.png" class="center" style="height: 500px;"/>

The estimation points are only available for features and every card should have a requester and an owner. The requester should take special care to give a
comprehensive description of the card and to use labels to recognize the card in relation with other cards in the same project. Labels could be anything. The
only rule is that they need to be useful. Also, whatever interaction between requester and owners (or related devs) should be registered into the card's activity for
future reference.

If a feature involves more than one story, the requester (or owner) should create an [Epic](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/blog/introducing-epics-they-re-like-stories-but-bigger/).
In simple terms, epics are cards that group a set of other cards which represent an entire feature as a whole. For example, if in the current iteration the
team needs to do a big feature which is splitted into several atomic features, then the atomic set of features compose an epic. In PivotalTracker, for
every epic exists a label (with a purple color) associated with that epic. Then, for every story that belongs to the epic, the dev should add that label, PivotalTracker
will do the rest:

<img alt="Epics" src="/images/epics.png" class="center" style="height: 500px;"/>

In the image above, PivotalTracker allows to click on "Add/View Stories" to have a full panel dedicated to the selected Epic. If you need to add relevant 
information to the epic, you should use the "Activity" section on the Epic.

It's important to note that __for every epic you should add a Release Card__ to the current Backlog. This card represents a marker that indicates when this
epic should be launched, so it's also important to set a release date to the release card:

<img alt="Release Card related with an epic" src="/images/release-card.png" class="center" style="height: 350px;"/>

If you have an atomic story that is not related with other stories in the current backlog, then is not necessary to create an epic and a release card. The
story by itself has the information of the release date for the specific feature.

### Velocity and Volatility

PivotalTracker has the ability to calculate in an automatic fashion the velocity for the current iteration of every sub-team. We recommend to follow their
recommendation mainly because it's based on the actual velocity of the previous iterations of the sub-team. Devs tend to be too optimistic in their estimations
so a more 'scientific' approach is always welcome. For the initial iterations, it is highly probable that your are going to struggle to adapt to the suggested
velocity of PivotalTracker but on next iterations the velocity will reach a more stable and representative value.

Another interesting concept in PivotalTracker is the volatility of the velocity in the team. This value represents the variation of the velocity through the
iterations in the project. For example:

* 1st iteration: 12 points
* 2nd iteration: 16 points
* 3rd iteration: 5 points

The volatility for the project is:

Volatility = (Standard Deviation of Velocity * 100) / Mean of Velocity = 50.5%

This is a extremely high value. As a rule of thumbs, teams should try to have a low volatility because in general terms the work of team should be as stable
as possible (in terms of productivity). A high volatility could reveal an unstable and unproductive team. PivotalTracker, gives all this metrics in a nice chart
and as simple as possible:

### Summary

In short:

* __Backlog Planning__:
 * First day of the iteration every team has a meeting where they plan the current iteration
 * Every feature should be added to the Icebox and they need to be as atomic as possible. If that is not possible (because of time constraints only), in no more than 
 two days the requester/owner should split the story in more atomic stories.
 * Every feature story in the backlog should be estimated without exception.
 * If a feature involves more than one story, then create an Epic and associate every story of the feature using the label of the epic.
 * For every Epic create a Release Card with a release date. Estimate the release date! 
 * You can't have an Epic without a Release Card.
 * For single stories (stories that by itself represent an entire feature) don't use Epics and Release Cards. Is not necessary.
 * At the end of the Backlog Planning there should be no stories in the Icebox.
* __During the Current Iteration__:
 * If you need to add more cards, do it. Don't add new feature cards unless they allow for a more atomic representation of a feature in the current backlog. In general
   you should be adding only new chore/bugs cards.
 * If a new features or a not so important bug/chore arrives, add it to the Icebox.
 * New bugs are solved by priority. If it has high priority then add it to the current backlog and solve it right away. For low priority bugs use your intuition and criteria (add them
   to the current backlog or to the icebox).
 * As soon as a story is finished click the finish button in PivotalTracker!
* __General Rules__:
 * Keep your boards organized. They are your day to day agenda, so if you keep boards organized your work is going to be organized too.
 * Keep control of the volatility: close features as soon as they are finished. Work on one (max two) stories at the same time. Choose the right type of card (are you
   marking a real feature as a chore? this is going to impact the real velocity of your team!).
 * Document and document again: decisions in the team tend to be forgotten through time unless they are documented. Use the Activity section on each card to document
   each decision regarding to that features/chore or bug.

## Conclusion

Organization of a development team can be hard if you not follow a structured methodology. Here at AD, We favor agile practices because they give us enough flexibility
in our day to day work but with enough structure to keep things organized. In practice, We use PivotalTracker as the online tool to apply our methodology and in this post
our general guidelines on how to use PivotalTracker were given. If you want to keep your team organized, We recommend:

* __Maintain a strong communication between team members__: use any form/tool of communication (in person, Slack, Hangouts, etc.) but communicate each other on your team.
Daily Meetings are a key tool to this. Communication can reduce development times by sharing knowledge and experience between devs and by avoiding misunderstandings in the
team.
* __Stay committed to the methodology__: adapt the methodology to suit your entire team but stay committed. It's worthless if for example only half of the team is committed
and the rest not. The entire team should be in the same direction.
* __Measure, track and review__: you should be constantly looking at how your team is doing. Look for key metrics such as estimated velocity, volatility, burndown and burnup 
charts. If you don't track you can't improve. Measuring and tracking allows management to adapt and take decision looking for improvement.
* __Document, document and document__: again, decisions are commonly forgotten if they are not documented. If some decision is important in the context of some feature or
task then document that decision. Your future self will thank you.
